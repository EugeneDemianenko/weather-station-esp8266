# Weather monitoring system
The project developed the ability of the ESP8266 microcontroller to collect data from external web resources and automated interaction with the user via messengers. The code provides a stable Wi-Fi connection, makes requests to the OpenWeather API, parses the responses, and displays the information in a convenient text format.

This project implemented a weather monitoring system. The system provides access to up-to-date information on temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction through integration with the OpenWeather API service. The user interacts with the device using a Telegram bot that receives commands and sends appropriate responses.
